👋 Hi, I’m Ekaterine Tchonishvili (@ekaterine199)
Fulbright Scholar | AI Researcher | MS in Artificial Intelligence @ Oregon State University
I am a dual-background researcher transitioning from a foundation in Biophysics and Physics to AI. My work focuses on the intersection of mathematical modeling and generative AI, with a proven track record of optimizing complex systems—from high-speed PCB models at Cisco to epidemiological forecasts.

🛠 Technical Toolbox
Languages: Python (Expert), C++, C#, MATLAB, SQL.
Machine Learning: PyTorch, TensorFlow, scikit-learn, LLMs, Generative Modeling.
Data Science: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Jupyter.
Engineering: Docker, Git, REST APIs, .NET, Signal Integrity.

🔬 Current Research & Focus
🎓 Master's in AI at Oregon State University (Fulbright Program).
🧬 Applying Generative Modeling to biological systems and complex datasets.
🚀 Seeking 2026 Internship roles in Machine Learning / AI.

🏆 Professional Highlights
Cisco: Engineered automation scripts that achieved a 5x efficiency gain (80% time reduction) in hardware modeling.
AI Hackathon Winner: 1st Place for a scalable recommendation engine prototype.
Academic Excellence: 4.0/4.0 GPA throughout Bachelor’s and Master’s in Physics/Biophysics.
Leadership: Former Leader of Google Developer Student Club (GDSC) and VP of Young Minds Tbilisi.

Collaboration Interests
I am looking to collaborate on:
Open-source ML/DL Frameworks.
Bio-inspired AI and mathematical modeling projects.
Scalable LLM applications and research-heavy repositories.
